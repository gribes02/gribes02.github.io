## Introduction

As a Software Developer specializing in infrastructure, I play a key role within the Delft Mercurians, a dedicated student team focused on advancing robotics technology for the RoboCup Small Size League. In this role specifically I am working on the path planning of the robots by either implementing ORCA or Model Predictive Control.

## Model Predictive Control

As of now the team is currently trying to implement MPC into the robots for local obstacle avoidance. As a way to start simple a 2D visualization was done to implement MPC.

#### State Space 

First step was to determine the state space model. Since the system is holonomic a point mass will be assumed for simplicity. Due to this assumption the state space can be expressed as:
